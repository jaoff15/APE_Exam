Phase 1.2 IO Placement/ Clock Placement/ Build Placer Device
INFO: [Timing 38-35] Done setting XDC timing constraints.
WARNING: [Place 30-574] Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y0
	FPGA2_inst/clocking_2_inst/clock_eng_1280_720A/BUFG_clk (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y3
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
WARNING: [Place 30-575] Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y0
	FPGA1_inst/clocking_1_inst/MMCME2_BASE_48_inst (MMCME2_ADV.CLKIN1) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on MMCME2_ADV_X1Y0
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.

INFO: [DRC 23-27] Running DRC with 8 threads
WARNING: [DRC PLCK-12] Clock Placer Checks: Poor placement for routing between an IO pin and BUFG. 
Resolution: Poor placement of an IO pin and a BUFG has resulted in the router using a non-dedicated path between the two.  There are several things that could trigger this DRC, each of which can cause unpredictable clock insertion delays that result in poor timing.  This DRC could be caused by any of the following: (a) a clock port was placed on a pin that is not a CCIO-pin (b)the BUFG has not been placed in the same half of the device or SLR as the CCIO-pin (c) a single ended clock has been placed on the N-Side of a differential pair CCIO-pin.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

	CLK100MHZ_IBUF_inst (IBUF.O) is locked to IOB_X1Y0
	FPGA2_inst/clocking_2_inst/clock_eng_1280_720A/BUFG_clk (BUFG.I) is provisionally placed by clockplacer on BUFGCTRL_X0Y3
WARNING: [DRC PLCK-23] Clock Placer Checks: Sub-optimal placement for a clock-capable IO pin and MMCM pair. 
Resolution: A dedicated routing path between the two can be used if: (a) The clock-capable IO (CCIO) is placed on a CCIO capable site (b) The MMCM is placed in the same clock region as the CCIO pin. If the IOB is driving multiple MMCMs, all MMCMs must be placed in the same clock region, one clock region above or one clock region below the IOB. Both the above conditions must be met at the same time, else it may lead to longer and less predictable clock insertion delays.
 This is normally an ERROR but the CLOCK_DEDICATED_ROUTE constraint is set to FALSE allowing your design to continue. The use of this override is highly discouraged as it may lead to very poor timing results. It is recommended that this error condition be corrected in the design.

WARNING: [DRC REQP-1580] Phase alignment: Unsupported clocking topology used for OSERDESE2 FPGA2_inst/hdmi_driver_inst/dvid_1/OSERDES_R/OSERDESE2_s. This can result in corrupted data. The FPGA2_inst/hdmi_driver_inst/dvid_1/OSERDES_R/OSERDESE2_s/CLK / FPGA2_inst/hdmi_driver_inst/dvid_1/OSERDES_R/OSERDESE2_s/CLKDIV pins should be driven by the same source through the same buffer type or by a BUFIO / BUFR combination in order to have a proper phase relationship. Please refer to the Select I/O User Guide for supported clocking topologies of the chosen INTERFACE_TYPE mode.
