TIMING-14#1 Warning
LUT on the clock tree  
The LUT FPGA1_inst/SpiTx/spi_tx_ddr_based_gen.spi_tx_ddr_based_inst/ODDR_MOSI_i_1 has been found on the clock tree. Run opt_design to optimize the clock trees, then re-run report_methodology. If LUT(s) are still present in the clock trees, modify the RTL or the synthesis options accordingly to move the clock gating logic to dedicated clock enable resources. Keep in mind that post-opt_design database cannot be used for pin-planning tasks
